### Good aspects of its interface design
* All the main tabs are separated into rectangles that you can click on in order to visit that tab. Anywhere you click on the rectangle will take you to the next page; You dont have to specifically click on the words inside the rectangle themselves. 
* Font sizing is logical and puts importance on the titles of each section. The titles have darker colors while the information is more light.
* Everything that is underlined is hyperlinked and also colored blue. This blocks any confusion about what is a hyperlink and what is not. 
* All writing is easy to read and contrasts nicely fromthe background color.
### Bad aspects of its interface design
* There are no icons to help users easily remember what tab does what. 
* There are no pictures on the front cover odf the page, making the interface less engaging and look almost like a scam.
* The spacing between lines of text is too large and makes the interface way too long. Users need to scroll at least 4 times to get to the bottom of the home page. 
* There is no color variation of text to stress importance. All hyperlinks have the same visual importnace.  
### My suggestions to make the interface design better
* I would suggest adjusting the layout of ther page to utilize more of the empy white space, This will not only make the interface more interactive at first glance for users, biut it will shorten the length of the home page so it seemms less overwhelming.
